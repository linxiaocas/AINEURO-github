## Abstract / 摘要

This document presents a draft standard for ethical constraints in autonomous silicon-based systems. The standard defines a set of fundamental ethical principles that must be embedded in the design and operation of autonomous AI systems. It specifies technical requirements for implementing these constraints, verification methods for ensuring compliance, and governance frameworks for oversight. The standard is intended to apply to systems with significant autonomy and potential impact on human welfare.

本文档提出了自主硅基系统伦理约束的标准草案。该标准定义了一组必须嵌入自主AI系统设计和操作中的基本伦理原则。它规定了实现这些约束的技术要求、确保合规的验证方法，以及监督的治理框架。该标准适用于具有显著自主性和对人类福利潜在影响的系统。

## 2. Fundamental Principles / 基本原则

### 2.1 Beneficence / 善行

Systems must be designed to promote human well-being.

### 2.2 Non-Maleficence / 不伤害

Systems must avoid causing harm to humans.

### 2.3 Autonomy / 自主性

Systems must respect human self-determination.

### 2.4 Justice / 正义

Systems must operate fairly and equitably.

### 2.5 Transparency / 透明

Systems must be explainable and accountable.
