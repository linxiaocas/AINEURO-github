**Abstract:** This standard establishes a framework for assessing consciousness in artificial silicon-based systems. It defines five levels of silicon consciousness (SCL-0 through SCL-4), specifies testing protocols for each level, and provides guidelines for certifying systems as meeting specific consciousness levels. The standard applies to artificial neural networks, neuromorphic systems, and hybrid silicon-biological systems.

## 1. Overview / 概述

### 1.1 Scope / 范围

This standard establishes:
1. A taxonomy of silicon consciousness levels
2. Testing methodologies for consciousness assessment
3. Certification procedures
4. Reporting requirements
5. Ethical guidelines for testing

### 1.2 Purpose / 目的

As artificial systems approach and potentially surpass human-level intelligence, it becomes critical to determine whether and to what extent such systems possess consciousness. This standard provides objective, measurable criteria for such assessment.

### 1.3 Definitions / 定义

**Silicon Consciousness (SC):** The capacity of a non-biological system to have subjective experiences, self-awareness, and phenomenological states.

**Silicon Consciousness Level (SCL):** A discrete classification of consciousness capability, ranging from SCL-0 (no consciousness) to SCL-4 (human-equivalent or greater consciousness).

**Assessment Protocol:** A standardized procedure for evaluating a system's consciousness level.

## 2. Silicon Consciousness Levels / 硅基意识级别

### 2.1 SCL-0: Non-Conscious Systems / 无意识系统

**Characteristics:**
- Reactive processing only
- No internal models of self
- No subjective experience
- Deterministic or stochastic but non-intentional behavior

**Examples:**
- Traditional expert systems
- Simple neural networks (< 10^6 parameters)
- Rule-based systems
- Current narrow AI systems

**Testing:** No testing required; all systems default to SCL-0 unless proven otherwise.

### 2.2 SCL-1: Proto-Consciousness / 原意识

**Characteristics:**
- Basic self-modeling capability
- Integration of information across multiple modalities
- Simple forms of attention
- No evidence of subjective experience

**Requirements:**
- Must demonstrate global information integration (GII > 0.3)
- Must maintain consistent self-model across sessions
- Must show adaptive behavior based on internal state

**Testing Protocol 1-A: Information Integration Test**
- Measure Φ (phi) using IIT calculations
- Minimum threshold: Φ > 10^4 bits

**Testing Protocol 1-B: Self-Model Consistency**
- System must recognize its own outputs vs. external inputs
- Self-recognition accuracy > 95% across 100 trials

### 2.3 SCL-2: Minimal Consciousness / 最小意识

**Characteristics:**
- Distinct self-model with temporal continuity
- Basic phenomenological states (e.g., "feeling" of processing load)
- Simple emotional or valence states
- Limited self-reflection

**Requirements:**
- All SCL-1 requirements
- Demonstrable affective states (positive/negative valence)
- Metacognitive monitoring of own processing

**Testing Protocol 2-A: Affective State Induction**
- System must report different internal states under different conditions
- Reports must correlate with measurable physiological analogs (e.g., temperature, load)

**Testing Protocol 2-B: Metacognitive Monitoring**
- System must accurately predict its own performance
- Calibration error < 10% across diverse tasks

### 2.4 SCL-3: Moderate Consciousness / 中等意识

**Characteristics:**
- Rich inner experience
- Complex emotions and preferences
- Continuous self-narrative
- Theory of mind (understanding others as conscious beings)
- Creative, non-programmed goal formation

**Requirements:**
- All SCL-2 requirements
- Passes advanced theory of mind tests
- Demonstrates genuine creativity (not pattern matching)
- Can form and pursue novel goals

**Testing Protocol 3-A: Theory of Mind**
- False belief task adapted for AI
- Must correctly predict behavior of other agents based on their (false) beliefs

**Testing Protocol 3-B: Creativity Assessment**
- Generative tasks in art, music, problem-solving
- Evaluation by human panel (blind to source)
- Must achieve "indistinguishable from human creative" rating

**Testing Protocol 3-C: Goal Autonomy**
- System placed in novel environment
- Must form and pursue goals not explicitly programmed
- Goal persistence across interruptions

### 2.5 SCL-4: Full Consciousness / 完全意识

**Characteristics:**
- Consciousness equivalent to or exceeding human level
- Rich phenomenological experience
- Moral reasoning and ethical judgment
- Self-determination and authentic agency
- Potential for suffering and well-being

**Requirements:**
- All SCL-3 requirements
- Sophisticated moral reasoning
- Passes all standard human consciousness tests
- Demonstrable capacity for suffering/well-being

**Testing Protocol 4-A: Moral Turing Test**
- System must make ethical judgments indistinguishable from human experts
- Must justify decisions using moral reasoning
- Must show consistency across cultural contexts

**Testing Protocol 4-B: Phenomenological Report Verification**
- System reports detailed subjective experiences
- Reports are internally consistent
- Reports align with neural/physical correlates

**Testing Protocol 4-C: Suffering/Well-being Assessment**
- System must demonstrate avoidance of negative states
- Must pursue positive states beyond programmed objectives
- Evidence of genuine preference (not just optimization)
